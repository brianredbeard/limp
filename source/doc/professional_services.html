<p>Do you have demanding logging requirements? Why not talk to a
real logging professional? Instead of trying to find the solution
like a needle in the haystack, talk to the team that brought rsyslog,
LogAnalyzer, the Windows MonitorWare products and other logging
solutions. We sweat logging for over 15 years now and can help quickly.
Depending on your needs, consulting can be carried out via email, the
phone or on your premises (for larger or local projects). Everything is
possible, it just depends on your needs. Consulting services are
available in English and German. Just mail <a href="mailto:sales@adiscon.com">sales@adiscon.com</a> what you are interested in and we will work with you on a proposal that fits your needs.
